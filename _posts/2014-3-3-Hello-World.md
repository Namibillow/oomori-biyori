As I graduated from university, I decided to get a master's in my interested field which was NLP or CL area. 

Although I did my undergrad in the US, this time I wanted to choose from different countries for my master's. Europe and Asia came to me naturally due to their somewhat cheap education costs compare to the US and those English speaking countries. 

Here's the summary of schools/programs I've applied (and the results) for master's:

- Tsinghua University in China (Accepted)
- University of Copenhagen in Denmark (Accepted) 
- University of Amsterdam in Netherland (Pre-accepted) 
- KU Leuven in Belgium (Accepted)
- Saarland University in Germany (Accepted)
- Erasmus Mundus Language Communication and Technology AKA LCT program (Accepted and took the offer) 

There were few more schools I was considering to apply, but at the end I didn't. 

I'll try to write a blog post about why or how I choose to attend the LCT program.

Overall, the process of applying to grad schools were hectic. The most annoying part I found was gathering different paperworks from different places in time. For those planning to apply for next school year, I highly reccomend to prepare as much as you could in early time. A year before should be good. Even though I tried to plan carefully and submitted applications a week early for most of the schools, there were some issues and delays. You really want to make sure that you read school's admission page, check their requiements and how they want you to submit the documents. 

I'm happy that it is over and I get to enjoy somewhat relaxed summer, although I'm stuck at home due to the pandemic... 

If anyone has questions regarding how to apply above schools for Master's, I'm happy to help you. Just send me an email or leave a comment.
